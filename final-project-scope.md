# Project Scope Statement - Final Project
## Project Purpose
Demonstrate the skills in project management, documentation, and web development that I have learned throughout the Fundamentals of Computing Applications course.
## Project Description
Create a project proposal, including planning documentation and a two-page website, within a single GitHub repository. This website will revolve around my hobby of watching movies.
## Desired Results
The repository should:
- Be available to the public
- Contain a README.file that includes a link to the live website and a link to the docs/folder
- Contain a docs/folder, which includes the following Markdown files: scope.md, plan.md, and retrospective.md
- Contain the following website files: index.html, about.html, and style.css
- Include a functioning link from the index.html page to the about.html page (vice versa)
- Submit the repository's URL in Canvas
## Exclusions
No programming languages other than Markdown, HTML, and CSS are needed.
## Feedback Loops
One classmate needs to peer-review my scope.md file by February 22. I then have to incorporate their feedback into my revisions of the scope.md file.
## People Resources
Since this is a solo project, I am the only person working on it.
## Priorities
1. Quality: This is the most important, as ensuring that all requirements are fulfilled in a satisfying manner is key to success.
2. Time: The project should be submitted by the due date of March 1, as a late submission can significantly harm chances of success.
3. Budget: This is the least important, as there are no financial resources required to use GitHub for this project.
## Acceptance Criteria
The professor, Mrs. Chalen, is required to sign off on this project and give it a grade after it is submitted.
